## Overview

**Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)** aims to adapt a model trained on
synthetic data to real-world data without requiring expensive annotations of
real-world images. As UDA methods for semantic segmentation are usually GPU
memory intensive, most **previous methods operate only on downscaled images**.
We question this design as low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve
fine details. The alternative of training with random crops of high-resolution
images alleviates this problem but falls short in capturing long-range,
domain-robust context information.

Therefore, we propose **HRDA**, a multi-resolution training approach for UDA,
that combines the strengths of small high-resolution crops to **preserve fine
segmentation details** and large low-resolution crops to **capture long-range
context dependencies** with a learned scale attention, while maintaining a
**manageable GPU memory** footprint.

HRDA enables adapting small objects and preserving fine segmentation details.
It significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance **by 5.5 mIoU for
GTA→Cityscapes** and **by 4.9 mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes**, resulting in an
unprecedented performance of 73.8 and 65.8 mIoU, respectively.

The more detailed domain-adaptive semantic segmentation of HRDA, compared to
the previous state-of-the-art UDA method DAFormer, can also be observed in
example predictions from the Cityscapes validation set.

## Comparison with SOTA

HRDA significantly outperforms previous works on several UDA benchmarks.
This includes synthetic-to-real adaptation on GTA→Cityscapes and
Synthia→Cityscapes as well as clear-to-adverse-weather adaptation on
Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich.

## Setup Environment

For this project, we used python 3.8.5. We recommend setting up a new virtual
environment:

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/hrda
source ~/venv/hrda/bin/activate
```

In that environment, the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

Further, please download the MiT weights from SegFormer using the
following script. If problems occur with the automatic download, please follow
the instructions for a manual download within the script.

```shell
sh tools/download_checkpoints.sh
```

**Data Preprocessing:** Finally, please run the following scripts to convert the label IDs to the
train IDs and to generate the class index for RCS:

```shell
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/synthia.py data/synthia/ --nproc 8
```

## Testing & Predictions

The provided HRDA checkpoint trained on GTA→Cityscapes
(already downloaded by `tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be tested on the
Cityscapes validation set using:

```shell
sh test.sh work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef
```

The predictions are saved for inspection to
`work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef/preds`
and the mIoU of the model is printed to the console. The provided checkpoint
should achieve 73.79 mIoU. Refer to the end of
`work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef/20220215_002056.log` for
more information such as the class-wise IoU.

If you want to visualize the LR predictions, HR predictions, or scale
attentions of HRDA on the validation set, please refer to [test.sh](test.sh) for
further instructions.

## Training

For convenience, we provide an [annotated config file](configs/hrda/gtaHR2csHR_hrda.py)
of the final HRDA. A training job can be launched using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/hrda/gtaHR2csHR_hrda.py
```

The logs and checkpoints are stored in `work_dirs/`.

For the other experiments in our paper, we use a script to automatically
generate and train the configs:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp <ID>
```

More information about the available experiments and their assigned IDs, can be
found in [experiments.py](experiments.py). The generated configs will be stored
in `configs/generated/`.

When evaluating a model trained on Synthia→Cityscapes, please note that the
evaluation script calculates the mIoU for all 19 Cityscapes classes. However,
Synthia contains only labels for 16 of these classes. Therefore, it is a common
practice in UDA to report the mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes only on these 16
classes. As the Iou for the 3 missing classes is 0, you can do the conversion
`mIoU16 = mIoU19 * 19 / 16`.

The results for Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich are reported on
the test split of the target dataset. To generate the predictions for the test
set, please run:

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --test-set --format-only --eval-option imgfile_prefix=labelTrainIds to_label_id=False
```

The predictions can be submitted to the public evaluation server of the
respective dataset to obtain the test score.

## Checkpoints

Below, we provide checkpoints of HRDA for different benchmarks.
As the results in the paper are provided as the mean over three random
seeds, we provide the checkpoint with the median validation performance here.

* [HRDA for GTA→Cityscapes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6n1HearrXHZTHxNRWp8HCMyqbulKcSW/view?usp=sharing)
* [HRDA for Synthia→Cityscapes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6kSLq3FH8o-FJf-syiiQx6E74ML9Huw/view?usp=sharing)
* [HRDA for Cityscapes→ACDC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pwb1NAKx-WeVdhKEfafn29_JP4iEyKQM/view?usp=sharing)
* [HRDA for Cityscapes→DarkZurich](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEfolITfZWA_gvtTtVgv8oa-exP9PEo0/view?usp=sharing)

The checkpoints come with the training logs. Please note that:

* The logs provide the mIoU for 19 classes. For Synthia→Cityscapes, it is
  necessary to convert the mIoU to the 16 valid classes. Please, read the
  section above for converting the mIoU.
* The logs provide the mIoU on the validation set. For Cityscapes→ACDC and
  Cityscapes→DarkZurich the results reported in the paper are calculated on the
  test split. For DarkZurich, the performance significantly differs between
  validation and test split. Please, read the section above on how to obtain
  the test mIoU.
