## Overview

**Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)** aims to adapt a model trained on
synthetic data to real-world data without requiring expensive annotations of
real-world images. As UDA methods for semantic segmentation are usually GPU
memory intensive, most **previous methods operate only on downscaled images**.
We question this design as low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve
fine details. The alternative of training with random crops of high-resolution
images alleviates this problem but falls short in capturing long-range,
domain-robust context information.

Therefore, we propose **HRDA**, a multi-resolution training approach for UDA,
that combines the strengths of small high-resolution crops to **preserve fine
segmentation details** and large low-resolution crops to **capture long-range
context dependencies** with a learned scale attention, while maintaining a
**manageable GPU memory** footprint.

![HRDA Overview](resources/hrda_overview.png)

HRDA enables adapting small objects and preserving fine segmentation details.
It significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance **by 5.5 mIoU for
GTA→Cityscapes** and **by 4.9 mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes**, resulting in an
unprecedented performance of 73.8 and 65.8 mIoU, respectively.

![UDA over time](resources/uda_over_time_hrda.png)

The more detailed domain-adaptive semantic segmentation of HRDA, compared to
the previous state-of-the-art UDA method DAFormer, can also be observed in
example predictions from the Cityscapes validation set.

HRDA can be further **extended to domain generalization** lifting the requirement
of access to target images. Also in domain generalization,
HRDA significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance by **+4.2 mIoU**.

## Comparison with SOTA UDA

HRDA significantly outperforms previous works on several UDA benchmarks.
This includes synthetic-to-real adaptation on GTA→Cityscapes and
Synthia→Cityscapes as well as clear-to-adverse-weather adaptation on
Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich.

**Data Preprocessing:** Finally, please run the following scripts to convert the label IDs to the
train IDs and to generate the class index for RCS:

```shell
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/synthia.py data/synthia/ --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/mapillary.py data/mapillary/ --nproc 8
```

## Testing & Predictions

The provided HRDA checkpoint trained on GTA→Cityscapes
(already downloaded by `tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be tested on the
Cityscapes validation set using:

```shell
sh test.sh work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef
```

The predictions are saved for inspection to
`work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef/preds`
and the mIoU of the model is printed to the console. The provided checkpoint
should achieve 73.79 mIoU. Refer to the end of
`work_dirs/gtaHR2csHR_hrda_246ef/20220215_002056.log` for
more information such as the class-wise IoU.

If you want to visualize the LR predictions, HR predictions, or scale
attentions of HRDA on the validation set, please refer to [test.sh](test.sh) for
further instructions.

## Training

For convenience, we provide an [annotated config file](configs/hrda/gtaHR2csHR_hrda.py)
of the final HRDA. A training job can be launched using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/hrda/gtaHR2csHR_hrda.py
```

The logs and checkpoints are stored in `work_dirs/`.

For the other experiments in our paper, we use a script to automatically
generate and train the configs:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp <ID>
```

More information about the available experiments and their assigned IDs, can be
found in [experiments.py](experiments.py). The generated configs will be stored
in `configs/generated/`.

When evaluating a model trained on Synthia→Cityscapes, please note that the
evaluation script calculates the mIoU for all 19 Cityscapes classes. However,
Synthia contains only labels for 16 of these classes. Therefore, it is a common
practice in UDA to report the mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes only on these 16
classes. As the Iou for the 3 missing classes is 0, you can do the conversion
`mIoU16 = mIoU19 * 19 / 16`.

The results for Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich are reported on
the test split of the target dataset. To generate the predictions for the test
set, please run:

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --test-set --format-only --eval-option imgfile_prefix=labelTrainIds to_label_id=False
```

The predictions can be submitted to the public evaluation server of the
respective dataset to obtain the test score.

## Domain Generalization

HRDA/DAFormer for domain generalization (DG) is located on the DG branch, which can
be checked out with:

```shell
`git checkout dg
```

They can be trained for DG using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp 50
```

For further details, please refer to [experiment.py](experiments.py). The model is
directly evaluated on Cityscapes during training with GTA data only. It can be additionally
evaluated on BDD100K and Mapillary with [tools/test.py](tools/test.py):

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --eval mIoU --dataset BDD100K
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --eval mIoU --dataset Mapillary --eval-option efficient_test=True
```

## Checkpoints

Below, we provide checkpoints of HRDA for different benchmarks.
They come together with the log files of their training.
As the results in the paper are provided as the mean over three random
seeds, we provide the checkpoint with the median validation performance here.

The checkpoints come with the training logs. Please note that:

* The logs provide the mIoU for 19 classes. For Synthia→Cityscapes, it is
  necessary to convert the mIoU to the 16 valid classes. Please, read the
  section above for converting the mIoU.
* The logs provide the mIoU on the validation set. For Cityscapes→ACDC and
  Cityscapes→DarkZurich the results reported in the paper are calculated on the
  test split. For DarkZurich, the performance significantly differs between
  validation and test split. Please, read the section above on how to obtain
  the test mIoU.
* The logs for domain generalization (DG) provide the validation performance on Cityscapes.
  Please, refer to the section above to evaluate the checkpoint on BDD100K and Mapillary.
